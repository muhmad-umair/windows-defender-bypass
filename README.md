# RShell (C# ‚Äî Educational Reverse Shell)

RShell is a minimal reverse shell written in **C#**.  
It exists **strictly for educational and defensive research**‚Äîto study .NET networking, process I/O redirection, and blue-team detection strategies in a controlled lab.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Use

**Authorized use only.** This project is provided to:
- Learn how reverse shells function at a code level.
- Run controlled, consented, and documented tests in your **own** lab.
- Improve defensive detections and incident response.

**You must not** use this software to access systems without explicit written permission.  
By using, copying, or modifying this code, **you agree** that:
- You have legal authorization to run any tests you perform.
- You accept full responsibility for outcomes and compliance with all applicable laws and policies.
- The authors and contributors are **not liable** for misuse, damage, or legal consequences.

> This README intentionally omits operational exploitation steps (e.g., setting up listeners, evasion tactics) to avoid facilitating misuse.

## ‚ú® What You‚Äôll Learn

- TCP client basics in .NET (`System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient`)
- Stream handling with `StreamReader` / `StreamWriter`
- Process creation and I/O redirection via `System.Diagnostics.Process`
- Event-driven output handling (`OutputDataReceived`, `ErrorDataReceived`)
- Blue-team visibility considerations and defensive controls

---

## üß© How It Works (High-Level)

1. Creates a TCP client and connects to a specified IP and port.
2. Launches **PowerShell** as a child process (hidden window).
3. Redirects PowerShell **stdin/stdout/stderr** through the TCP stream.
4. Forwards remote input to PowerShell; returns command output back over the connection.
5. Ends when the remote side sends `exit` or the process terminates.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The sample uses `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`. In real environments, this is a risky setting and often monitored. Keep this **only** for isolated lab study.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build (Windows)

You can build with Visual Studio or the .NET SDK. This project targets Windows due to the PowerShell path in `Program.cs`.

### Option A ‚Äî Visual Studio
1. Create a new **Console App** (C#).
2. Replace the default `Program.cs` with the one in `src/Program.cs`.
3. Build in **Release** mode.

### Option B ‚Äî .NET SDK (CLI)
If you prefer SDK-style:

```bash
dotnet new console -n RShell
# Copy your Program.cs over the generated one
dotnet build -c Release RShell
Option C ‚Äî CSC (C# compiler)
If the .NET compiler is available on PATH:

bash
Copy code
csc src\\Program.cs -out:RShell.exe
If you change the PowerShell path or add cross-platform support, document those changes in this README.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Runtime Parameters
The program expects two arguments:

php-template
Copy code
RShell.exe <ip> <port>
<ip>: Destination IP (string)

<port>: Destination port (integer)

Note: This is for lab use only in environments you own/control and are authorized to test. Do not point this at networks or hosts without written consent.

üîç Code Walkthrough
Key elements in Program.cs:

Networking: TcpClient client = new TcpClient(); client.Connect(ip, port);

Streams: Wraps the network stream with StreamReader/StreamWriter for line-oriented I/O.

Process: Launches PowerShell via ProcessStartInfo with:

UseShellExecute = false

Redirection for StandardInput, StandardOutput, StandardError

Hidden window (ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden)

Event Handlers: Subscribes to OutputDataReceived / ErrorDataReceived to forward output lines back over the socket.

Loop: Reads remote lines and writes to p.StandardInput until exit.

Consider adding robust error handling, logging to a local file (in lab), and graceful shutdown behavior for educational completeness.

üß™ Safe Lab & Testing Guidance (High-Level)
To keep this ethical and safe:

Isolate your lab. Use local VMs or containers on a closed network with no internet egress. Snapshots help you revert quickly.

Document consent. If collaborating, get written permission (scope, dates, systems, data handling).

Least privilege. Use non-admin test accounts and non-production systems/data.

Observe & learn. Pair your runs with monitoring (process creation logs, PowerShell logging, network telemetry) to understand blue-team visibility.

No operationalization here. This README does not include listener setup or exploitation steps. If you don‚Äôt already know how to safely simulate endpoints in a closed lab, focus on the code and defensive detections first.

üõ°Ô∏è Blue-Team Notes (Defensive Study)
When running in a lab, explore how the following controls observe activity:

PowerShell Logging: Script Block, Module, and Transcription logging.

AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface): Scans PowerShell content before execution.

Process Creation Events: E.g., Windows Event ID 4688 / Sysmon Event ID 1.

Network Telemetry: Egress connections, unusual destinations/ports.

Command-line Auditing: Visibility into -ExecutionPolicy Bypass usage.

Questions to ask in your lab:

Which alerts fire?

What telemetry is missing?

How could defenders detect similar behavior earlier?

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Ideas (for Learning)
If you extend the project (in your lab), consider educational toggles:

PowerShell Path: Make configurable for different Windows versions.

Timeouts/Retries: Connection timeouts, backoff.

Graceful Exit: Signals to terminate child process cleanly.

Logging (Lab Only): Optional local log for teaching/troubleshooting.

Authentication/TLS (Lab Only): Explore secure channels and identity‚Äîuseful for defensive design discussions.

Do not add evasion features or anti-forensic behavior. Such contributions will be rejected.

üö´ Known Limitations
Windows-only due to the hardcoded PowerShell path.

No encryption/authentication on the TCP channel (lab artifact).

Minimal error handling‚Äîfor clarity in learning.

No reconnection logic or persistence (by design).

Requires interactive remote input (no job control).

‚ùì FAQ
Q: Why omit listener/exploitation instructions?
A: To avoid facilitating misuse. This project is for understanding code paths and defensive visibility, not for operationalization.

Q: Can I change -ExecutionPolicy Bypass?
A: Yes‚Äîthis is a learning artifact. In your lab, experiment with stricter settings and observe behavior and logs.

Q: Will you accept PRs adding stealth/evasion?
A: No. This repo is focused on education and defense.

ü§ù Contributing
